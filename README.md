Data Analytics

Founded in 2002, Quantium has a long history of innovation in data science across all sectors of the economy. As a rapidly growing global leader in data science and AI, the company is dedicated to growing the team of ambitious, diverse, and fun employees! The team of employees work together to harness the power of data to drive revolutionary change that benefits us all and deliver the best results for the clients.

Through this program, I was acting as a data analyst at Quantium and took part in the challenging but fun work the data analysts do daily! I learned practical skills such as data validation, data visualisation, statistical testing and more. After completing each module, I am able to compare my work with real model solutions created by the Quantium team for a chance to learn directly industry leaders.
